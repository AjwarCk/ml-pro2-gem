# Gemstone Price Prediction - 

## Introduction About the Data : 

The dataset, the goal is to predict price of given diamond (Regression Analysis).

There are 10 independent variables (including id):

- id : unique identifier for each diamond
- carat : carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstone and diamonds.
- cut: quality of dimond cut.
- color : color of diamond.
- clarity : diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics udner 10-power magnification.
- depth: the depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the cutlet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface).
- table: A diamond's table is the facet which canb be seen when the stone is viewed face up.
- x : diamond X dimension.
- y : diamond y dimension.

##### Target Variables :

- price : price of the given diamond.

**It is observed that the categorical variables 'cut','color' and 'clarity' are ordinal in nature.**

### Approach for the project

1. Data Ingestion :

    - In Data Ingestion phase the data is first read as csv.
    - The the data is split into train and test and saved as csv file.

2. Data Transformation : 

    - In this phase a column transformation pipeline is created.
    - For numeric variables first simpleimputer is applied with strategy median, then standard scaling is performed on numeric data.
    - For categorical variables simpleimputer with most freequent strategy, then ordinal encoding performed, after this data is scaled with standard Scaler.
    - This preprocessor is saved as pickle file.

3. Model Training : 

    - In this phase base model is tested. The best model found was catboost regressor.
    - Post this hyperparameter tuning is performed on catboost and knn model.
    - A final votingregressor is created which will combine prediction of catboost, xgboost and knn models.
    - This model is saved as pickle file.

4. Prediction Pipeline : 

    - This pipeline converts given data into dataframe and has various functions to load pickle files and predict the final results in python.

5. Flast App Creation :

    - Flask app is created with user interface to predict the gemstone prices inside a Web Application.
